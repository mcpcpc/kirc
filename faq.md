## FAQs

**KISS** is an acronym for [Keep It Simple Stupid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), which is a design principle noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960s. The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.

**POSIX** is an acronym for [Portable Operating System Interface](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/what-posix-richard-stallman-explains), which is a family of standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. The *C99* Standard is preferred over other versions (e.g. *C89* or *C11*) since this currently the only one specified by [POSIX](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/c99.html).
