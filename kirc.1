.TH KIRC 1 "December 2025" "kirc 1.0.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
kirc \- a tiny, dependency-light IRC client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kirc
.RB [<options>]
.RB <nickname>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B kirc
is an extremely fast and simple IRC client designed with portability in mind,
following the "Keep It Simple, Stupid" (KISS) philosophy. It provides a
keyboard-driven interface for IRC communication.
.PP
This client reads from STDIN and prints to STDOUT, so all traffic can be
multiplexed and text parsed or modified using external commands. All highlighted
text and color can be controlled with ANSI escape sequences.
.PP
For best results and rendering, use a terminal emulator with 256 color support,
such as xterm-256color.

.SH DCC FILE TRANSFERS
.B kirc
supports Direct Client-to-Client file transfers, including XDCC file requests
commonly used on IRC file servers.
.PP
When another user sends you a file via DCC SEND, kirc will automatically detect the
incoming file transfer request and begin downloading the file the current working
directory. The file transfer will display:
.DL dcc: receiving <filename> from <sender> (<size> bytes)
.PP
Transfer progress and completion messages will appear as the file downloads. To request
a file from an XDCC bot, use the standard XDCC request format:
.PP
.DL /ctcp <botname> XDCC SEND #<packet_number>
.PP
The bot will initiate a DCC SEND transfer, which kirc will automatically handle. Note
that kirc supports up to 16 simultaneous DCC transfers. Files are saved to the current
working directory with their original filenames.
