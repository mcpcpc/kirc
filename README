kirc
====

kirc is a tiny, dependency-light IRC client that follows the
"Keep It Simple, Stupid" (KISS) philosophy. It is intended for
users who prefer a minimal, keyboard-driven IRC experience in a
terminal environment.

Features
--------

* Small, portable C codebase with minimal runtime requirements
* Keyboard-centric editing and navigation
* Simple command and message aliases for fast interaction
* Lightweight build using a standard Makefile

Install
-------

Build and install from source (system-wide install requires
appropriate privileges):

    git clone https://github.com/mcpcpc/kirc
    cd kirc/
    make
    sudo make install

Alternatively, run the binary from the repository root after
building: `./kirc`.

Usage
-----
At minimum, supply a nickname to connect. For full options, see
the manpage or run `kirc -h`.

    kirc [-s server] [-p port] [-c channels] [-r realname]
         [-u username] [-k password] [-h] <nickname>

Examples
--------

Connect to the default host with nickname `alice`:

    kirc alice

Connect to a specific server and join channels:

    kirc -s irc.example.org -p 6667 -c "#foo,#bar" alice

Commands & Aliases
------------------

    @<dest> <message>  send `PRIVMSG` to a specified user or channel.
    /<command>         send a raw command to the IRC server.
    /#<channel>        set a new default message channel.
    /$                 toggle the channel filter on/off.

Key Bindings
------------

Control keys are mapped to familiar text-editing bindings:

    CTRL+B             move cursor left
    CTRL+F             move cursor right
    CTRL+E             move cursor to end of line
    CTRL+A             move cursor to start of line
    CTRL+U             delete entire line
    CTRL+C             force quit kirc

Configuration
-------------

kirc is intentionally minimal and uses command-line options for
configuration. If you need persistent settings, wrap your
invocation in a shell script or alias.

------------
